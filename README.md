This project enhances the security and reliability of our Ubuntu servers by implementing three key best practices. 
We establish a strong password management strategy, enforce regular software updates to address vulnerabilities, and utilize centralized log file monitoring to detect and respond to security threats. 
By integrating robust password policies, automated update processes, and comprehensive logging systems, we aim to fortify our defenses, ensure system integrity, and protect our organizationâ€™s assets and reputation.
